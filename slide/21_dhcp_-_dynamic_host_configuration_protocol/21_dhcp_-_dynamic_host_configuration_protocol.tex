\section{DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically provides a hostwith its IP address and other related configuration information such asthe subnet mask and default gateway.
		\item DHCP clients obtain their IP configuration information from a DHCPserver, rather than being manually configured.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\frametitle{DHCP Benefits – Reduced Network Admin}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Centralized and automated IP configuration, rather than manuallyassigning an IP address to every host.
		\item Can assign additional IP configuration values by means of DHCPoptions.
		\item Efficient handling of clients that must be updated frequently, such aslaptops that move to different locations on a wireless network.
		\item The forwarding of initial DHCP messages by using a DHCP relay agent,which eliminates the need for a DHCP server on every subnet.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DHCP Benefits - Reliable IP address configuration}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DHCP minimizes configuration errors caused by manual IP addressconfiguration, such as typos, or address conflicts caused by theassignment of an IP address to more than one computer at the sametime.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{DHCP Clients}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Desktop PCs are good candidates to be DHCP clients because there willtypically be many of them in an office. Using DHCP saves a lot of adminwork that would be necessary if manually configuring IP addresses.
		\item They do not accept incoming connections so it does not matter if theirIP address changes.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DHCP Clients}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Servers and network infrastructure devices such as routers andswitches will not typically be DHCP clients.
		\item They are mission critical devices which do not move and are requiredfor the network and its services to function.
		\item Their IP addresses are manually configured to ensure they will notchange and are not dependant on DHCP.
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Configuring a Cisco Router as a DHCP Client}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cisco routers are typically manually configured with static IP addresses
		\item An exception to this is where an office is connected to the Internet buthas not bought static public IP addresses (because it does not containany publicly available servers which would need a fixed IP address forincoming connections)
		\item The office still requires a public IP address to allow internal hostsoutbound connectivity to the Internet through NAT
		\item In this case the router will receive the public IP address on its outsideinterface from the Internet service provider via DHCP
